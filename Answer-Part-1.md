plan/test strategy instead of complete test cases.


* Cover test case for each 3rd party signup journey (continue with apple, google, facebook) and make sure the data matchup with the one who sign up

* Cover test case for each care needed country (singapore, malaysia, australia) 

* cover test case for each functioanlity (example: not fill out all mandatory field should make the continue button disable)

* cover test case for cross-playform (example: signup with google in iOS, then continue the rest process in android)

* cover test case for active account/on progress signup account cannot sign up

* cover test case for interrupt (kill apps while get the otp)

* if there is any update regarding signup, cover test case for backward compability (example: signup with apple in iOS older version, and then continue the process with newest version)
